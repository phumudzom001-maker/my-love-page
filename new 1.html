            <h1>ELIHLE ALONDWE GUMEDE AND PHUMUDZO C MUNANYI</h1>
            <p>There are certain things in life that defy logic—feelings that escape the grip of reason, that can’t be put into neat, labeled boxes or explained in a way that makes sense even to yourself. That’s exactly what my love for her feels like. It’s unexplainable, not because I lack the words, but because no words could ever fully capture what she means to me.

From the outside, it might look ordinary. We talk, we laugh, we share time and space like any two people do. But inside me, something shifts every time she walks into the room. It’s not just attraction, not just affection, and certainly not infatuation. It’s deeper, more complicated, and yet so simple: I love her. Without needing a reason. Without expecting anything back. I just do.

There wasn’t a single moment I can point to and say, “This is when it happened.” It wasn’t a dramatic fall. It was a quiet unfolding, a realization that she had settled into my heart in a way no one else ever has. Maybe it's the way she laughs, without trying to be perfect. Maybe it’s how she listens—really listens—when I speak. Or maybe it’s something in her silence, the kind that feels more comforting than most conversations. I could list a thousand reasons why she’s amazing, but none of those explain why I love her like I do. The truth is, I’d love her even if none of those reasons existed.

There are days I try to make sense of it. I question why my heart chose her, of all people. We’re not perfect, we have our differences, and life hasn’t always made it easy. But still, I feel this pull toward her, like gravity, quiet and constant. Like the ocean pulled to the moon, even when it's unseen.

Some people say love should be logical, mutual, measurable. But this love—my love for her—exists outside all of that. It doesn't need to be returned to be real. It doesn't need validation to be powerful. It's not something I control, and maybe that's the most beautiful—and terrifying—part about it. I didn’t plan to love her. I didn’t ask for it. But here I am, loving her all the same.

Maybe that's what makes it unexplainable. It's not love built on conditions or reasons—it’s love that just is. And honestly, I don’t want to explain it. I just want to feel it, live it, and if I’m lucky, share even a piece of it with her.</p>
